Release History
***************

Historically, the release number of PyXB indicated stability in a way similar
to that of Linux several years ago, with even/odd of the middle digit
indicating stability/development.  That policy ended as of 1.1.3, and the
relaxed policy is:

- All releases consist of three non-negative integers

- A release *series* refers to all releases with the same first two integers.
  The third integer indicates an incremental update to the system.

- Should it be necessary to make wholesale changes that affect either
  stability or interface, the second or even first integer will be
  incremented

- Critical bug fixes may result in new releases in older series, but this is
  expected to be extremely unusual.  Such fixes will be made on a branch of
  the :ref:`git repository <git_repository>`.

- All packaged releases are intended to be of comparable stability, with bug
  fixes and most enhancements causing an increment in the third integer

As an example, it is likely that :ticket:`correcting the content model for
weak determinism <112>` will result in PyXB 1.2.0, and :ticket:`support of
Python 3 <150>` will result in PyXB 2.0.0.


1.1.x
=====

1.1.4 (15 Jun 2012)
-------------------

Key features of the release:

- A large number of bug fixes, especially in the area of internationalization.
  Naive uses of unicode have mostly been eliminated.
- Corrections and improvements to date and time-related types, especially with
  respect to timezones.
- More namespaces have been added in the :ref:`common <bundle_common>`,
  :ref:`WS-* <bundle_wssplat>`, and :ref:`OpenGIS <bundle_opengis>` bundles.
- This release eliminates the separate packages for different bundles; all
  bundles and documentation except for OpenGIS are incorporated into the
  release file.  OpenGIS is present but must be built manually; see
  :ref:`OpenGIS <bundle_opengis>`

Examples have been added:

- ``examples/customization`` shows advanced customization, including injecting
  behavior into binding classes corresponding to types from which other XML
  types are extended or restricted.  It also demonstrates how to introspect
  the bindings within a module, automating much of the process of extending
  multiple bindings with the same functionality.

- ``examples/unicode_jp`` demonstrates internationalization features including
  the ability to intercept PyXB's construction of Python identifiers from XML
  identifiers to produce meaningful identifiers when the schema language is
  not compatible with the Python 2 requirement that identifiers be ASCII.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyxb/>`_ have been addressed:

1.1.3 (09 Sep 2011)
--------------------

General cleanup, finish up a few previously unsupported datatypes.

- Correct extension of a simple type with enumeration restrictions.
  :ticket:`89`

- Use the Python string type as the basis for `xs:hexBinary
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#hexBinary>`_.
  :ticket:`90`

- Support ``+`` in ``PYXB_ARCHIVE_PATH`` like the documentation says.
  :ticket:`92`

- Correct exception reference.  :ticket:`93`

- Correct handling of the `ur-type
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-1-20010502/#key-urType>`_.  :ticket:`94`

- Automatically provide an `xsi:type <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi_type>`_
  attribute when the schema uses the ur-type.  :ticket:`95`

- Implement `xs:base64binary
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#base64Binary>`_.
  :ticket:`83`, :ticket:`96`

- Fix pickling and URI path issues on Windows.  :ticket:`97`, :ticket:`98`

- Correct extensions that involve wildcards.  :ticket:`100`

- Do a better job resolving circular dependencies, and don't try to write two
  namespace groups to the same binding file.  :ticket:`104`, :ticket:`105`

- Add a bundle for :ref:`Security Assertion Markup Language <bundle_saml20>`.
  Thanks to Michael van der Westhuizen for providing this (sixteen months
  ago).  :ticket:`106`

- Avoid overwrite of Python `built-in constants
  <http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html>`_, including ``None``,
  ``True``, and ``False``.  :ticket:`107`


1.1.2 (30 May 2010)
-------------------

Complete replacement of the model group portion of the content model.  The
NFA-to-DFA approach is gone.  The resulting system does a better job in less
space and significantly faster: 30% faster on the standard tmsxtvd test,
orders of magnitude on documents with large sequences of optional elements.

Note: A couple unit tests fail due to incidental reasons that will be
addressed when fixing :ticket:`75`.  Also, the architecture documentation for
the validation portion of the content model is completely out of date.

- Handle sequences of optional elements more effectively.  :ticket:`33`

- Correct multi-step attribute restriction/extension.  :ticket:`80`

- Support prefix rewrite for schema location URIs.  :ticket:`81`

- Fix syntax error generating wildcard namespace constraints.  :ticket:`84`

- Support whitespace validation bypass in simple type definitions.  :ticket:`85`


1.1.1 (28 Jan 2010, rev 2135)
-----------------------------

Major feature is significantly improved ability to determine what content is
not acceptable to the validating parser, and where it can be found in the
document.  See :ref:`invalid-content`.

Also, using keyword parameters in binding instance constructors will now raise
an :api:`pyxb.exceptions_.ExtraContentError` in the case where the keyword does not
correspond to the PyXB-generated identifier associated with an attribute or
element of the class being instantiated.

- Eliminate complaints about reference to deprecated :mod:`sha` module in Python
  2.6.

- Fix assorted problems with mixtures of :ref:`pyxbgen--binding-root`,
  :ref:`pyxbgen--module-prefix`, and :ref:`pyxbgen--write-for-customization`.
  :ticket:`64`, :ticket:`65`

- Eliminate unnecessary attempts to download schema for builtin namespaces.
  :ticket:`63`

- Avoid assertion failure when provided schema location's content looks a
  little, but not enough, like a schema document.  :ticket:`72`

- References to declarations in other namespaces are now calculated locally to
  the module, rather than cached under the expectation the name is valid
  everywhere.  :ticket:`73`

- Imposed consistency on behavior when document root element is not
  recognized.  :ticket:`74`

- Partial implementation of improved error data stored in exceptions.
  :ticket:`75`

- Detect invalid keywords in instance constructor calls.  :ticket:`76`


1.1.0 (30 Nov 2009, rev 2092)
-----------------------------

Mostly nit-picky things, but some changed interface, so we're starting a new
beta series.

- Make handling of invalid xsi:type attributes more robust.  :ticket:`56`

- Use validation flags to control validation (what a novel concept).
  :ticket:`57`

- Fix improper generation of content within elements marked as xsi:nil.
  :ticket:`58`

- Provide mechanism to control default handling of xsi:type attributes in
  instance documents.  :ticket:`60`

- Fix bug where constraining facets were not inherited when deriving simple
  types by restriction.  :ticket:`61`


1.0.x (Stable)
==============

1.0.0 (18 Oct 2009, rev 2068)
-----------------------------

Nobody seems to have found anything critical for a while, and it does what I
want it to, so we'll let this thing run free.

- Replace a reference to a non-existent variable with something that works.
  :ticket:`52`

- Consistently validate instances created from documents no matter which
  parser is used.  :ticket:`53`

- Support caching message references in WSDL SOAP faults.  :ticket:`54`

0.7.x (Beta)
============

0.7.3 (15 Sep 2009, rev 2050)
-----------------------------

A few bug fixes (one major), a couple new features, and separation of the
various components to allow a smaller distribution.

- Fixed a circular reference in the DFA state classes that caused memory bloat
  in long-running processes.  :ticket:`49`

- When PyXB renames an XML element or attribute due to a collision with a
  reserved word, it will write a warning, and at runtime will raise an
  exception if an attempt is made to assign to the original name.
  :ticket:`50`, :ticket:`51`

- Support for pattern restrictions for string-based simple types.
  :ticket:`47`

- Split distribution into multiple files to reduce download size:

   - ``PyXB-base-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Complete release, nothing pre-built
   - ``PyXB-doc-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with pre-built documentation
   - ``PyXB-common-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with XHTML bindings
   - ``PyXB-opengis-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with OpenGIS bindings
   - ``PyXB-wsspat-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with WS-* bindings
   - ``PyXB-full-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Complete release with all overlays


0.7.2 (25 Aug 2009, rev 1981)
-----------------------------

Primarily to fix a problem with chameleon schemas, but also a couple other
minor issues.

- References to QNames with absent namespaces in chameleon schema included
  into schema with a target namespace could not be resolved.  :ticket:`46`

- Documentation content was not correctly sanitized for use within a Python
  docstring.  :ticket:`45`.

- Elements with complex types with simple content that derived from string
  could not be marked as nil.  :ticket:`48`

0.7.1 (23 Aug 2009, rev 1968)
-----------------------------

None of the enhancements really got in, but lots of minor bug fixes.

- Restored the ability to dump copies of all schemas retrieved from a remote
  location, so you can review them.  :ticket:`28`

- Fixed assorted problems with simple types constructed by list and union.
  :ticket:`35`, :ticket:`40`

- Provide link from content values to the element binding that was used to
  store them.  Useful for quickly identifying the owner element when
  generating a valid child sequence for conversion to DOM.  :ticket:`36`

- Fix validation of attributes with union types.  :ticket:`37`

- Enumeration fixes: Only generate class-level constants for enumerations that
  restrict a string representation (not double, float, etc).  Verify
  enumerations work correctly on list and union constructions.  Duplicate the
  class-level constants for enumerations that are defined in union member
  types.  :ticket:`38`

- Provide a facility to simplify the automatic creation of an instance of the
  appropriate type when storing values into an element.  Makes life with
  anonymous local elements a lot easier.  :ticket:`39`

- Enhance management of namespace prefixes by allowing a system-wide default
  in BindingDOMSupport and by inferring the base name of the module as the
  default prefix for namespaces defined in imported bindings.  :ticket:`41`

- Provided crude facility to bypass validation when generating and parsing
  documents.  :ticket:`44`

- Re-arrange the help for pyxbgen's arguments, and add a script to
  automatically generate the Sphinx tables for it.

- Support bundles of related schemas/namespaces, currently wssplat (for WS-\*)
  and opengis (Geographic Information Systems).

- Got the user-level documentation back up to where it might actually help
  somebody.


0.7.0 (03 Aug 2009, rev 1715)
-----------------------------

This release is identical to 0.5.2 except that the binding interface has
completely changed.  All examples have been updated; the documentation will be
updated later.

Note that the code in PyXB itself has not changed, and is not going to
change.  However, properties produce an interface more natural to most Python
programs, so that has become the default style.  See the --binding-style
parameter to pyxbgen if you want to change this.

- Change the method of accessing elements and attributes in bindings from
  accessor methods (e.g., elt.attr(), elt.setAttr()) to properties (e.g.,
  elt.attr).  :ticket:`18`


0.5.x (Beta)
============

0.5.2 (03 Aug 2009, rev 1706)
-----------------------------

Mostly changes to namespaces in support of profiles and application schemas
which extend other namespaces with special components, or have their own
copies of somebody else's schemas, etc.  See the pyxbgen private/public
namespace switches.

- Presence of nested choice model groups caused the plurality calculations to
  be wrong: some elements were dropped from the model, others were treated as
  lists when only one instance would be permitted.  :ticket:`34`

- Content accessor would return wrong value for elements with simple type of
  list variety.  :ticket:`32`

- Corrected handling of attributes when deriving complex types by
  restriction.  :ticket:`27`

- Added a source module for XML namespace
  (http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace) with bindings linked to the built-in
  component model.  :ticket:`23`

- Fix inadequacies in namespace archive management.  :ticket:`22`

This is expected to be the last release in 0.5.x.  0.7.0 should follow soon
thereafter, and only contain the change of default binding style from accessor
to property.  :ticket:`18`


0.5.1 (16 Jul 2009, rev 1502)
-----------------------------

Fixed various problems with OpenGIS schemas, specifically dependency loops
induced by attempting to keep binding components within modules identified by
the schema they came from, and loss of bindings for one namespace due to its
being overwritten by those for another.

- The presence of a wildcard in a sequence or choice model group caused other
  elements to be lost in the binding.  :ticket:`29`

- Rework content verification to operate on binding instances rather than DOM
  nodes.  :ticket:`24`

- Use `value()` to extract the value of a complex type with simple content;
  the `content()` method works only with element and mixed content.
  :ticket:`21`

- Add support to specify prefix to be used in QNames when generating DOM
  documents from binding instances.  Provide facility to re-use the
  BindingDOMSupport instance for multiple conversions.  :ticket:`15`

- Tightened requirements on content type matching: no more will strings and
  numbers automatically be converted to match the content model (probably for
  a branch you didn't intend).  :ticket:`14`

- Fix problems overwriting binding modules with data from a different set of
  namespaces.  :ticket:`31`.

- Eliminated the schema group modules: too hard to avoid dependency loops.
  Now all components are written into a single module, which is a namespace
  group module if the components cross namespaces.  A namespace-specific
  module still exists, and imports only the relevant components from the group
  module.


0.5.0 (07 Jul 2009, rev 1446)
-----------------------------

Ability to parse many of the OpenGIS schemas (gml, iso19139, citygml, ogc,
ogckml22, om, ows, sensorML, sos, swe, tml, ...).

- Completely rework include and import directives to correctly handle relative
  paths in ``schemaLocation`` attributes and to only import from a given
  location once per namespace. :ticket:`9`, :ticket:`8`, :ticket:`5`

- Parse ``final`` attribute on type definitions (though this has no effect on
  the bindings).  :ticket:`10`

- Complete missing implementations in complex types with simple content.
  :ticket:`6`

- Create new code generation model which supports inter-namespace and
  inter-schema dependency cycles.  Namespace archives can now holds all
  namespaces that depend on each other.

- Other miscellaneous. :ticket:`11`

- Did I mention the ability to handle OpenGIS?  :ticket:`16`

Beware:

- Most of the classes in the new code generation model are undocumented.

- The interface to `pyxbgen` has changed completely.  Look at
  ``examples/OpenGIS/makebind.sh`` or other scripts in the ``examples``
  directory.


0.4.x (Stable)
==============

0.4.0 (20 Jun 2009, rev 1204)
-----------------------------

First usable public release.

- Use expanded names for all declarations and definitions. :ticket:`1`

- Use the finite automaton content model for generation as well as
  parsing. :ticket:`2`

- Support xsi:type and xsi:nil. :ticket:`3` 

- Support substitution groups. :ticket:`4` 

- Fix many problems in QName resolution

- Implement the remaining date/time types

- Rework content model so binding instances are always instances of the
  binding for the corresponding XML type, with no intervening element
  instance

- Add support for SAX parser

0.2.x (Stable)
==============

0.2.0 (30 May 2009, rev 818)
