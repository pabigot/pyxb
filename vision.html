<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This historical document was written in early 2009 prior to PyXB
development in order to bound the scope of the project and record the
critical use cases.  It has not been updated in response to lessons
learned during development.</p>
</div>
<p>PyXB is intended to support automated generation of Python language classes
that conform in structure to data types defined with the W3C XML Schema.</p>
<div class="section" id="origins">
<h2>Origins<a class="headerlink" href="#origins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PyXB was developed to support interaction with arbitrary web services from
Python.</p>
<p>Service oriented architecture, specifically in the form of web services, has
gained much traction in recent years.  While languages like Java and C++
have a variety of commmercial, free, and open source utilities to help
bridge the gap between web service standards and software, Python has been
much less developed.  Built-in support is limited to processing of XML
documents.</p>
<p>Some external packages are available to support SOAP and WSDL, but they were
found to be unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons, both an inability to
process complex schema like those for KML or SAML and a Python interface
that was not natural.</p>
<div class="section" id="generateds">
<h3>generateDS<a class="headerlink" href="#generateds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Reliance on a SAX processor, and use of a code generation scheme that was
difficult to modify, made the code difficult to work with.  It seemed
infeasible to extend the implementation to support Pythonic schema bindings
that used different styles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zsi">
<h3>ZSI<a class="headerlink" href="#zsi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This system supports generation of bindings that allow web services to be
invoked, but XML schema support is secondary to SOAP and WSDL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-goals">
<h2>Design Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#design-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PyXB must be able to process the schema used to describe standard web
services documents, including but not limited to the following namespaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>[XMLSchema]</li>
<li>[wsdl]</li>
<li>[soap]</li>
<li>[soap bindings]</li>
<li>[http bindings]</li>
<li>[mime bindings]</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard conformance is a high priority.  In addition to official standards
such as those from W3C and OASIS, industry prevalence should guide selection
among conflicting standards.  This applies not only to standards that are
supported by PyXB, but those used in its development.</p>
<p>Python data structures bound to data types in these namespace should be as
close as possible to those that would have been hand-written by a user.  As
an example, elements that may only appear once should correspond to fields
with a object value; those that may appear multiple times should correspond
to fields with an iterator value.  Values recognized through a model group
definition should be broken down into direct references to the underlying
element (not passed through some intermediate structure).</p>
<p>Speed of the resulting bindings when used within Python code is a secondary
concern to usability of the bindings.  Speed of conversion between bound
objects and XML is a tertiary concern.</p>
<p>The bindings must be able to generate Python objects corresponding to the
data held within an XML document that validates against the schema from
which the bindings were derived.</p>
<p>The bindings must be able to generate XML that conforms to the schema from
which they were derived.</p>
<p>A facility must be provided through which custom behavior can be attached to
the Python objects derived from PyXB.</p>
<p>PyXB should support generating a module on a per-namespace basis.  The
module should include the necessary information to process schemas that
depend on the namespace, as well as bindings for the namespace.  Modules
supporting the namespaces listed above should be provided along with PyXB.
It should be possible for users to dynamically add available namespaces.</p>
<p>It should be possible to customize the generated binding code.  It is a goal
to allow PyXB to generate code for other languages, though the
capabilities of that code may be inherently limited or require additional
tools.</p>
<p>PyXB and its generated bindings must work with a relatively current Python
2.x installation.  Bindings generated by PyXB must require no packages or
external programs except those that come as part of a standard Python
distribution.  At a minimum, bindings must be supported by Python
distributions 2.3 and later.</p>
<p>While the generated bindings should not require additional packages, they
should allow use of such packages when available.  For example, use in a
system that provided a high-speed DOM implementation that would improve
performance should not be excluded.</p>
<p>PyXB itself should require no additional Python packages except those that
come as part of a standard Python package.  There may be additional
functionality that is supported when certain packages are available.  At a
minimum, PyXB SHOULD run under Python version 2.4 and later.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to require that the schemas processed by PyXB validate
against the W3C specification.  PyXB is not itself required to perform any
validation.  Given an invalid schema, PyXB SHOULD provide a diagnostic
indicating any fault that prevents processing of the schema.</p>
<p>It is not required that generated bindings support validation of instance
documents.  This function may be added through a customized binding
generator.</p>
<p>It should be possible to implement PyXB in terms of the bindings it
generates from the XMLSchema namespace.  At least conceptually.</p>
<p>The licensing of PyXB and code it generates should be consistent with the
Open Source Definition.  An exception is acceptable for material produced by
a custom generator that does not incorporate PyXB material in its output.</p>
