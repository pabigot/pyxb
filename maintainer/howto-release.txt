* Update the release notes in doc/releases.txt.  All fixed DRs should be
  noted, as well as any major new features.

* Update the version number in setup.py.  Run:

  ./setup.py update_version
  hg commit -m 'Version number updated for release'

* Run the maintainer/makedist script.  This exports the current directory's
  repository into /tmp, then does a full setup, documentation build, and
  test in that area.  It creates the variant bundles, and places them in
  ~/pyxb/pre-release.

* In ~/pyxb/pre-release, run the testdist.sh script.  This unpacks the full
  distribution, builds, installs, and runs the full test sequence on three
  versions of Python.  Check out the logs for any errors.

* When all tests pass, move the release tar files into ~/pyxb/pyxb-release.
  Create a file notice-A.B.C.txt containing the section of doc/releases.txt
  relevant to the release.   Add all these to the repository, and push it.

* Back in the development repository, update setup.py for the next release
  series, run ./setup.py update_version, and commit the changes.

* Log in to SourceForge, and under Project Admin enter File Manager.  Create
  a new release directory under pyxb, then upload each files.  Later files
  come earlier in the list, so a good order is: opengis, common, wssplat,
  base, doc, full.

* For each upload, click on the gear and set its properties:

   notice-A.B.C.txt -- Release notes (mark as release notes)
   full -- Full release with all overlays (mark as default download)
   doc -- Documentation overlay
   base -- Base release, no overlays
   wssplat -- Web service bindings overlay
   common -- Common schema bindings overlay
   opengis -- OpenGIS bindings overlay

  Also mark the full release as being the default download.

* Associate the release notes with the folder and the full release.

* Go to the Trac system. Under Milestones

 - Edit the milestone for the new release, setting its Completed date
 - Add the next beta series as a milestone, marking it as the default
 - Add the new release as a version, marking it the default

* Edit the main Trac page to select the correct versions for the DR tables.
  An example of a full page is in maintainer/trac-source.

* Log in to sourceforge and replace the homepage with the new documentation.
